Some of my favourite memories from undergrad so far have come from group projects, where I've gotten the chance to build new and interesting web apps, mobile apps, and design prototypes!",

In Operational Excellence, I leveraged my skills in Python to develop a suite of automation scripts to increase efficiency in tracking BMO server vulnerabilities and login metrics. This greatly reduced the amount of manual effort/activities required by the team, allowing them to focus on more urgent business tasks. As for Home Financing Cloud, I had the opportunity to work in AWS (CodePipeline, DynamoDB, Lambdas, Cloudwatch) to migrate an existing on-premise system to the cloud. While it often seemed like there were too many moving parts to keep track of, it was a great introduction to cloud architecture and cloud development!"

        "description":"Throughout my second internship at Teranet, I was able to take on a greater leadership role and was given larger development tasks. For example, I led the end-to-end development of the Registration Tracking feature in Geowarehouse using AngularJS and Java Spring, providing 10+ real estate boards and commercial clients with data on recent property transactions. On the frontend side, I worked on improving the e-store by implementing dynamic product retrieval. Lastly, I performed a platform-wide data refresh using SQL and data analysis techniques, providing 85,000+ Geowarehouse users with accurate neighbourhood demographics data on all properties in Ontario."

Leveraging the cross-platform functionality of Nativescript, I created an intuitive UI and integrated the app with Azure RESTful APIs for user authentication, data retrieval and persistence. Overall, it was a really interesting experience to see how products are bootstrapped from the ground up, with the hopes that one day this could be presented to doctors and those in the medical industry."

One of my key contributions was redesigning the graduate research showcase page and integrating it with Mapbox tilesets that I created using Mapbox’s Javascript framework. Additionally, I reduced the amount of time required to load the platform by implementing Express.js endpoints to more efficiently serve assets. Overall, the time I spent working with faculty was incredibly rewarding, and provided an opportunity to work on impactful software that is now being used by city officials and local schools."

Throughout the term, I developed two new Automated Valuation Model reports that are now available to purchase in the Geowarehouse e-store for 85,000+ users! Additionally, I worked on optimizing the UI of client-facing property pages and expanded the data output of various web services."
